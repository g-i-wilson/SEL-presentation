Project Overview
	About 6 ago I was working for a company that made fire and gas safety equipment.
	In one of their carbon monoxide detection products, the CO sensing element part was being obseleted and discontinued by its manufacturer.
	At that time a different sensing element (from a different manufacturer) was being used in some CO detection products by other industry competitors, and I was asked to start prototyping some hardware with this particular CO sensing element.
