Design breakdown
	analog front-end
		amplification
			leakage currents
			op-amp circuit stability

			general feedback loop stability

			possible alternative: a switched capacitor before in-amp

			improvement: guarded traces (see INA116)

			possible alternative: single-ended:

		noise reduction
			sensor noise was temperature dependent
	extremely low pass filtering dilema
		analog too touchy (experience in college, methane drop sensor)
		must be in digital
	analog-digital conversion
		analog anti-aliasing filter
			https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/filter/filter_2.html
			why does this need to be analog? inifinite bandwidth -> finite (at less than -3db)
		bandwidth of ADC
			aliasing and nyquist theorem

		digital filtering
			FIR
				always stable				
				simple to create windowed-sinc FIR filter
					https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinc_filter
					https://tomroelandts.com/articles/how-to-create-a-simple-low-pass-filter
					inverse-fourier transform of rectangular is sinc
				more taps required for FIR filter, so higher minimum sampling rate
				for a given sample rate, have a long (but linear) phase delay
			IIR
				can be unstable (similar to analog op-amp filters)
				require only a few taps to implement 4 pole filter
				low phase delay

	Power concerns
		battery life -> MCU awake-time -> maximum sample rate
		sleep and turn off unnecessary circuitry
			https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tps22860.pdf?ts=1588279438983
	PCB design
		analog/digital power and ground separation
		analog signal paths
			guarded traces to reduce leakage current
			return current in ground plane
			increased trace separation
			PCB coating
		all reference grounds connect at one point
Design for test
	CO levels: https://gaslab.com/blogs/articles/carbon-monoxide-levels-chart
	defining boundaries
		sensor
			characterize (or check characterization)
		analog -> digital
			apply artificial micro-amp signal
			(serial port) record data curve aquired (compare to nominal data curve)
		alarm sound output circuit
			(serial port) trigger alarm circuit
	periodic/manual self-test
